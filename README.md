# Colour-Palette

Colour/color Palette is a simple application made from Delphi. It can create different colours according to code. All colours are shown in DBGrid and can be chosen among three colour code formats: Delphi/C++/HTML.

If DBGrid cell is clicked, its colour code will be shown in EditBox.

Hope this simple application can bring any kind of help.

Looking forward for any advice.
